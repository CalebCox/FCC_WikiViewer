# Wikipedia Viewer
This is a Wiki Viewer for freeCodeCamp's Front-End Certification projects. I decided to re-visit this project to give it a facelift and refactor the code, this repository contains the progress of the refactor. You can view the original solution via [Codepen here](https://codepen.io/Nestik/pen/QgWqzJ).

You can view the freeCodeCamp project details [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer).
